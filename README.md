## Welcome to My Pages!
I am **Jianyi Yang**.

I am a master student in [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](http://english.bupt.edu.cn/content/content.php?p=2_8_16) advised by Professor Lin Sang. I received my B. S. degree in Information Engineering from [Xidian University](http://en.xidian.edu.cn/About_Xidian/Overview.htm) in 2015. 

I will receive my **M. S.** degree in **2018 spring**, and I really hope to pursue a **Ph. D.** degree after that.

Detailed information about me is provided in my [**CV**](https://github.com/CoolYaung/CoolYaung.github.io/blob/master/CV_YANG(6).pdf).

### Research
Much of my master's work focuses on the application of compressed sensing in millimeter wave channel estimation.

Meanwhile, I have been researching on the theory of compressed sensing including approximated message passing (AMP).

I have also done some work on signal identification for cognitive radio (CR).

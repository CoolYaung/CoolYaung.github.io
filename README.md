### About me ([CV](https://github.com/CoolYaung/CoolYaung.github.io/blob/master/CVofJianyiYang.pdf))

I am a master student in [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](http://english.bupt.edu.cn/content/content.php?p=2_8_16) advised by Professor Lin Sang (GPA: 86.29). I received my B. S. degree in Information Engineering from [Xidian University](http://en.xidian.edu.cn/About_Xidian/Overview.htm) in 2015 (GPA: 88.76, Ranking 1/153).  

I will receive my **M. S.** degree in Information and Communication Engineering in **2018 spring**, and I really hope to pursue a **Ph. D.** degree in Information and Signal Processing Theory after that.


### Research
Much of my master's work focuses on the application of compressed sensing in millimeter wave channel estimation.

Meanwhile, I have been researching on the theory of compressed sensing including approximated message passing (AMP).  Some work is summarized in [GAMP: A Complete Derivation and its Application to 1-bit Measuring of AWGN Output](https://github.com/CoolYaung/CoolYaung.github.io/blob/master/GAMP%20A%20Complete%20Derivation%20and%20its%20Application%20on%201-bit%20Measuring%20of%20AWGN%20Output.pdf)

I have also done some work on signal identification for cognitive radio (CR).
